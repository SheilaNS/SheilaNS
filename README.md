### Hi there, my name is Sheila Nakashima dos Santos!
But you can call me Sheila :hugs:

I used to work as a pharmacist, but as I love to solve problems I decided to change carrers.
Nowadays I'm focused on studying web development at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/).

You can see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheila-nakashima-dos-santos/) or send me an e-mail: shei.nsantos@gmail.com.
